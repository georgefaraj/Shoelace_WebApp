# Shoelace WebApp

This is a temporary repository for my Shoelace Software Engineering Test.

Unfortunately I ran out of time and it is incomplete.

The way it would have worked is that a user starts working on one of the templates and if they decide to save it they would receive a JSON describing their work and they can keep on modifying it by inputing this JSON when prompted. Publish would've just returned an HTML describing the Campaign.

Big thank you to Shoelace for the opportunity.
